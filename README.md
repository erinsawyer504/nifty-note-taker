# Nifty Note Taker

## Description
This app keeps track of any notes or a to-do list you have to do for the day.  You can type in the title and description of the notes and then press a save icon for it to be saved to the left hand side of the page.  
If you have multiple tasks, you can click on each task to show the entire desctiption on the right side of the page again.  Once you finish a task, you can delete it by pressing the trashcan icon. 

I was given the front end code for this application and I had to design and code the back end piece.  I used express.js to connect to the client-side servre and back-end server nad Node.js for the file system. I used a uuid to create a function to generate a random number and export it to the server.js to randomly generate an ID# for the notes which allows it to be clicked on again to recall the data and also to delete it later when finished with the note. This application is also deployed on Heroku.
